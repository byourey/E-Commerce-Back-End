# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
Using the starter code provided, build the back end for an e-commerce site by configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. We are creating the models for Category, Product, ProductTag and Tag and then using the models in the api routes.

## Install
Clone repository.
Open your CLI.
Run the command line npm install for all the dependencies to be installed.
Create a database.
Type npm run start to start the application. The database and tables will be created.
Type npm run seed to insert data into the database.
Use Postman to check each of the API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for categories, products or tags to see the JSON data.
